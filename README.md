This script was written after games dragged on into the night. Simply, the script is useful late in the game when battles get longer and rolling becomes too tedious.

```
python risk.py
```
### Use
There is a simple command line interface to use the tool with the following commands:
-	```help```:              display these options
- ```fight all```:              fight until one army can no longer fight
- ```fight```:                  get the result of one fight
  - ```<ENTER>``` or ```y```:   fight again
  - ```n```:                    return to main menu
  - ```clear```:                clear the terminal
- ```exit```:                   leave the command line interface
- ```clear```:                  clear the terminal
